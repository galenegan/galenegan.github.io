Hello and welcome to my website. I am a Research Scholar in the Geosciences Department at Princeton University. I conduct research in fluid dynamics and physical oceanography, with a particular focus on low-cost and distributed sensing techniques.

Before Princeton, I worked in both academia and industry: I was an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department at Seattle University, where I taught undergraduate math and graduate level data science courses. And before that, I worked for three years as a Data Scientist and Senior Research Scientist at Sofar Ocean, an ocean tech startup based in San Francisco. I completed my PhD and a stint as a postdoctoral scholar in the Bob and Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory at Stanford University. Working with Professors Stephen Monismith and Oliver Fringer, I conducted field work in San Francisco Bay with the goal of developing physics-based parameterizations for processes such as cohesive sediment erosion and flocculation in wave and current-driven turbulent flows.

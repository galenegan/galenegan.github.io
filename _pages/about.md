Hello and welcome to my website. I am a Lecturer and Research Scholar in the Geosciences Department at Princeton University. I conduct research in fluid dynamics and physical oceanography, with a particular focus on observations at the air-sea interface.

Before Princeton, I worked in both academia and industry in a variety of roles: 

- Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department at Seattle University, where I taught undergraduate math and graduate level data science courses.
- Data Scientist and Senior Research Scientist at Sofar Ocean, an ocean tech startup based in San Francisco. And though I am no longer at Sofar full time, I still do data science and software development consulting work with their awesome Optimization Engine team.
- PhD student and Postdoctoral Scholar in the Bob and Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory at Stanford University. Working with Professors Stephen Monismith and Oliver Fringer, I conducted field work in San Francisco Bay with the goal of developing physics-based parameterizations for processes such as cohesive sediment erosion and flocculation in wave and current-driven turbulent flows.

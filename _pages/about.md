I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department at Stanford University. I work with Oliver Fringer in the [Bob and Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Lab](https://cee.stanford.edu/research/labs-centers/bob-and-norma-street-environmental-fluid-mechanics-laboratory). My research is focused on developing physics-based parameterizations for processes such as cohesive sediment flocculation in wave and current-driven turbulent flows. Ultimately, this work will be applied towards improving the predictive capabilities of numerical sediment transport models. This is a natural extension of my PhD research where, working with [Stephen Monismith](https://profiles.stanford.edu/stephen-monismith), I studied cohesive sediment transport by conducting field work in South San Francisco Bay. In my spare time I enjoy cooking elaborate dinners, [fly fishing](../images/flyfishing.jpeg), and [writing Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/user_details_reviews_self?userid=yosI54Xkh_tT0iL6U8STCQ).

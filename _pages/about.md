Hello and welcome to my academic website. I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at Sofar Ocean, and will soon be starting as an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department at Seattle University. I am interested in applying data-driven methods to problems in fluid dynamics and physical oceanography, with a particular focus on low-cost and distributed sensing techniques. 

Before Sofar and Seattle U, I completed my PhD and a stint as a postodctoral scholar in the [Bob and Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Lab](https://cee.stanford.edu/research/labs-centers/bob-and-norma-street-environmental-fluid-mechanics-laboratory) at Stanford University. Working with Professors Stephen Monismith and Oliver Fringer, I conducted field work in San Francisco Bay with the goal of developing physics-based parameterizations for processes such as cohesive sediment erosion and flocculation in wave and current-driven turbulent flows. In my spare time I enjoy cooking elaborate dinners, [fly fishing](../images/flyfishing.jpeg), and [writing Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/user_details_reviews_self?userid=yosI54Xkh_tT0iL6U8STCQ).

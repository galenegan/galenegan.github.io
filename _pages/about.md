Hello and welcome to my website. I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department at Seattle University. I teach undergraduate math and graduate level data science courses, and conduct research in fluid dynamics and physical oceanography, with a particular focus on low-cost and distributed sensing techniques. 

Before Seattle U, I was a Senior Research Scientist at Sofar Ocean, an ocean tech startup based in San Francisco, and before that I completed my PhD and a stint as a postdoctoral scholar in the Bob and Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory at Stanford University. Working with Professors Stephen Monismith and Oliver Fringer, I conducted field work in San Francisco Bay with the goal of developing physics-based parameterizations for processes such as cohesive sediment erosion and flocculation in wave and current-driven turbulent flows. In my spare time I enjoy cooking elaborate dinners, [fly fishing](../images/flyfishing.jpeg), and [writing Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/user_details_reviews_self?userid=yosI54Xkh_tT0iL6U8STCQ).

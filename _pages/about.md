I am a PhD candidate in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department at Stanford University. I work with [Stephen Monismith](https://profiles.stanford.edu/stephen-monismith) in the [Bob and Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Lab](https://cee.stanford.edu/research/labs-centers/bob-and-norma-street-environmental-fluid-mechanics-laboratory). 

I study cohesive sediment transport by conducting field work in South San Francisco Bay. Using the data that I am collecting, I aim to develop physics-based parameterizations for processes such as cohesive sediment flocculation in wave and current-driven turbulent flows. Ultimately, this work will be applied towards improving the predictive capabilities of numerical sediment transport models. In my spare time I enjoy cooking elaborate dinners, [fly fishing](../images/flyfishing.jpeg) and [writing Yelp reviews](https://www.yelp.com/user_details_reviews_self?userid=yosI54Xkh_tT0iL6U8STCQ).

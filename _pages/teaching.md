## Material

Linked below are materials I developed for various classes. Feel free to use them for your own purposes if you find them useful. 

* GEO 390: Research Methods in Geosciences (Princeton University, Fall 2025)

  Undergraduate level course covering programming, statistics, and research fundamentals with geosciences applications. All lectures and assignments can be found in the public Github repo [here](https://github.com/galenegan/geo390-public/tree/main).

* Data 5100: Foundations of Data Science (Seattle University, Fall 2024)

  Graduate level course covering mathematical and programming prerequisites for data science. Selected materials include [Linear Algebra Notes](../files/LinearAlgebra.zip) and [Calculus and Optimization Notes](../files/CalculusAndOptimization.zip).

* CEE 262B: Transport and Mixing in Surface Water Flows (Stanford University, Winter 2018)

  Graduate level environmental transport course. I wrote these [Weekly Lecture Summary Notes](../files/transport_and_mixing.zip) as a grad student to help review the material before teaching the weekly discussion sections.
